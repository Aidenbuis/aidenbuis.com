Git can be quite intimidating. Maybe you recognize this scenario... 10+ Stack Overflow tabs open. Running Git commands without knowing what they do. Hoping that they fix the problem. I've been there. I used to just remember the common used commands. But how Git really worked? I had no clue.

This series of articles on Git dives into the inner workings of Git. Together we will look what happens under the hood of Git. The aim is to build a concise mental model on Git.

Let's start with the command `git init` to give birth to a new repository.

After you’ve done that you will see a new `.git` folder pop up in the directory. Inside that folder are the following folders and files. Let’s take a look at each one.

The `hooks/` folder contains your client- or server side hook scripts. An example of this is a pre-commit hook, that runs a check before it lets you commit.

The `info/` folder contains a file called `exclude`. This file is similar to `.gitignore` which you are probably familiar with. The difference between the two is that `.gitignore` is committed to the repository, whereas the `info/exclude` file is not. You can use the `info/exclude` file if you have files that live inside the repository but are specific to your workflow, and don’t have function for other users. I personally have never had the need to use it.

The `objects/` folder is where the magic happens. In it Git stores every change to the repository. A big part of this section will focus on how Git does this.

The `refs/` folder stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more).

The `config` file contains your project-specific configuration options

The `description` file is only used by GitWeb, a web interface for Git. It comes automatically with Git. You can ignore this file.

The `HEAD` file points to the branch you currently have checked out.

The `index` file stores information about your staging area.
