Git can be intimidating. To not get overwhelmed in the beginning I just remembered the commands I needed and ran with it. But a good model of how Git works could have saved me a lot of stress when things went south.

Maybe you recognize this scenario. You have 10+ Stack Overflow tabs open and are running Git commands that you don't really understand. Hoping one of them will fix your problem. I've been there several times and I hated it.

That is when I decided to dive into the inner workings. This article is that deep dive. Together we build a concise mental model of Git. So that when things do go south, u know why you'll have to run certain commands.

Let's start with the command `git init` to add Git to this project.

<InnerWorkingsTerminal step={0} expectedCommand="git init" />

  We now have added Git to our repository. Let's create an empty text file with
  the command `touch text.txt`.
  <InnerWorkingsTerminal step={1} expectedCommand="touch text.txt" />
</SectionContainer>

<SectionContainer id={2}>
  We now have created an empty text file called `text.txt`. Let's check what the
  git status is by running `git status`.
  <InnerWorkingsTerminal step={2} expectedCommand="git status" />
</SectionContainer>

<SectionContainer id={3}>
  Git tells us that we have an untracked file. But what does 'untracked' really
  mean? Under the hood Git works with three directories. The <Badge color="blue">working directory</Badge>, the  <Badge color="green">staging area</Badge> and the <Badge color="yellow">repository</Badge>.

The working directory is where you do your work. It is the folder on your computer that contains the code of your project. In this case it is the folder that contains the text.txt file we just created.

The staging area is the place where you can put your rough drafts. When you are ready to commit your changes, you can save them to the repository.

We can place things into our staging area with the `git add` command. When we want to save that to our repository we can use the `git commit`.
