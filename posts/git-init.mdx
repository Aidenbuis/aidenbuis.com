The command where it all starts: `git init`. When you run this command it creates a `.git` repository where pretty much everything Git needs is stored. In this section we will dive into what is contained in the `.git` folder.

First start by running `git init` in the terminal. After you’ve done that you will see a new `.git` folder pop up in the directory. Inside that folder are the following folders and files. Let’s take a look at each one.

- hooks/
- info/
- objects/
- refs/
- config
- description
- HEAD

The `hooks/` folder contains your client- or server side hook scripts. An example of this is a pre-commit hook, that runs a check before it lets you commit.

The `info/` folder contains a file called `exclude`. This file is similar to `.gitignore` which you are probably familiar with. The difference between the two is that `.gitignore` is committed to the repository, whereas the `info/exclude` file is not. You can use the `info/exclude` file if you have files that live inside the repository but are specific to your workflow, and don’t have function for other users. I personally have never had the need to use it.

The `objects/` folder is where the magic happens. In it Git stores every change to the repository. A big part of this section will focus on how Git does this.

The `refs/` folder stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more).

The `config` file contains your project-specific configuration options

The `description` file is only used by GitWeb, a web interface for Git. It comes automatically with Git. You can ignore this file.

The `HEAD` file points to the branch you currently have checked out.

The `index` file stores information about your staging area.
